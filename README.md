**The contribution of the basal ganglia and cerebellum to motor learning: a neuro-computational approach**\
*submitted.*

The code will be released upon acceptance.

The code in the folder "Reaching" contains the model definitions and implements the reaching task. The number of goals (2 and 8 used in the manuscript) can be changed as a parameter in iCub_jiggling_reservoir.py.  

The code in the folder Adaptation are the version of the files required for simulating the adaptation task. The three conditions of the task can be simulated by making the appropiate changes in iCub_jiggling_reservoir.py. The same model definitions in Reching are required.
