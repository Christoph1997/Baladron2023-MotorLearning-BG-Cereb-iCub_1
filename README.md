The code in the folder `Reaching/` contains the model definitions and implements the reaching task. The number of goals (2 and 8 used in the manuscript) can be changed as a parameter in `iCub_jiggling_reservoir.py`.  

The code in the folder `Adaptation/` are the version of the files required for simulating the adaptation task. The three conditions of the task can be simulated by making the appropriate changes in `iCub_jiggling_reservoir.py`. The same model definitions as in `Reaching/` are required.
